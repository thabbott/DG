# Discontinuous Galerkin code for a linear wave equation

Use this code if you want to watch a sine wave propagate to the right with a phase speed of $$2\pi$$, and maybe increase the time step until the simulation becomes unstable.

Don't use this code if you want to do anything more complicated than that.
